Plausible Analytics aims to give you easy to understand and quick access to useful insights so you can focus on your website. One way you can navigate and analyze your Plausible dashboard even faster is by using keyboard shortcuts. 

We've tried to make Plausible as usable and accessible as possible with just a keyboard. These are the keyboard shortcuts that we do support within each dashboard:
